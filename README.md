# Separation Logic for Unrestricted Effect Handlers

This work proposes a novel calculus based on Staged Separation Logic 
(SSL) to support unrestricted effect handlers, 
where zero/one/multi-shot continuations co-exist together with imperative effects.
SSL summaries behaviors in stages, 
explicitly revealing performed algebraic effects;
and allows modular descriptions/reasoning for  
effectful programs and their handlers. 
Our staged specification intuitively provides insights into unhandled effects 
and failed assertions. 
To show the feasibility, we prototype the automated verification system, 
prove its correctness, report 
on case studies, and present initial experimental results. 



# Working Examples:

All the example in 'src/evaluation' folder. 
In particular, 

- (example for exchange values ) 
dune exec ./hip.exe ../src/evaluation/11_exchange.ml

- (paper example multi-shot demonstration)
dune exec ./hip.exe ../src/evaluation/0_heap_zero_once_twice.ml
dune exec ./hip.exe ../src/evaluation/1_heap_zero_once_twice.ml
dune exec ./hip.exe ../src/evaluation/2_heap_zero_once_twice.ml


- (paper example multi-shot demonstration ==> weakened version)
dune exec ./hip.exe ../src/sp_tests/0a_heap_zero_once_twice.ml

- (paper example state monad examples) 
dune exec ./hip.exe ../src/sp_tests/2_memory_cell.ml   
dune exec ./hip.exe ../src/sp_tests/2a_memory_cell.ml
dune exec ./hip.exe ../src/sp_tests/2b_memory_cell_mix_handler.ml
dune exec ./hip.exe ../src/sp_tests/2c_memory_cell_mix_handler.ml

dune exec ./hip.exe ../src/sp_tests/3_memory_cell_nested.ml
dune exec ./hip.exe ../src/sp_tests/3a_memory_cell_nested.ml

dune exec ./hip.exe ../src/sp_tests/3b_memory_cell_nested.ml
has a bug

# SYH old entailment (hiplib)

2, 10, for normalization 
8, 11 for entailment 

8, 11: different results due to weakest precondition. the preconditions inferred for the actual impl seem a bit too strong?
2: has req F. new entailment seems correct, should be false?
10, write_handler: is the spec right? there's no prior info about x1
10, read_handler: depends on write_handler, TBC

# What is inside the `root directory` ?

There are four main files/folders under the root directory:
- Makefile: a make file to make sure the parsing is working 
- README.md: instructions of get hands on the project
- parsing: the folder contains the source code
    1. "parsetree.ml": contains the AST structure 
    2. "parser.mly": implements the parser 
    3. "hip.ml": the main file of our forward verifier and entailment checking 
    6. "Pretty.ml": contains most of the pretty printing functions
- src: the folder contains the test cases
    2. "evaluation/": contains the test cases for the evaluation 



eval $(opam env)

TODO:
design the experiments to show that:
re-reasoning does not cause too much overhead. 
we can reason about multi-shot efficiently. 



======HIGH ORDER=======
1. dune exec ./hip.exe ../src/programs.t/test_ho.ml

2. dune exec ./hip.exe ../src/programs.t/test_new_entail.ml


TODO: write compose and applyN in 1 
verify the results in 2. 

# Development

Builds on OCaml 5. Check the [GitHub actions config](.github/workflows/main.yml) for the build dependencies.

`dune test` to run [tests](src/programs.t/run.t).

`dune exec parsing/hip.exe $EXAMPLE` to run examples. Effect-related programs are in [src/evaluation](src/evaluation), higher-order programs are in [src/examples](src/examples).

**Logging**

View log output by setting `DEBUG=n`.

| n    | What                                 |
| ---- | ------------------------------------ |
| 0    | Results                              |
| 1    | Explanations, for users              |
| >= 2 | More and more detail, for developers |

Add logging using `debug ~at:n ~title:"example" "format string %d" 1;`. `info` is an alias for `debug ~at:1`.

# Project structure

- Hipcore: core language and spec AST and pure functions for manipulating it
- Hipprover: code which depends on calls to an external prover, e.g. normalization
- Ocamlfrontend: OCaml parser
- Hiplib: interface for all the above modules
- Hipjs, Hip: CLI and web frontends
- Provers: prover back ends which translate Hipcore types into SMT

[This file](parsing/dune) lists the submodules of the various libraries.
